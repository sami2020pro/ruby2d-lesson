# Ruby 2D on Linux

# Install Ruby

<b>Installing Ruby with package managers (e.g. apt, yum, pacman) can cause issues. We recommend using a Ruby version manager instead, like rbenv. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:</b>

`git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv`

`git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build`

`export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"`

`eval "$(rbenv init -)"`

`source ~/.bashrc`

`rbenv install 2.6.2`

`rbenv global 2.6.2`

`rbenv versions`

`ruby -e "puts 'Hello Ruby'"`

# Install Packages

<b>Ruby 2D needs a few packages to tap into low-level graphics and hardware. Install the following for your Linux distribution.</b>

*Ubuntu, Debian, and Mint*:
`sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`
